# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create a webpage that would allow me to add my notes from completing of the Prework Study Guide. I am currently learning a lot of information so I needed a place where I could easily make notes. I built this to help organise my ideas and have a resource that was easy to refer back to when needed. Now all of my notes are in one easily accessible place. During this project I learn basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
